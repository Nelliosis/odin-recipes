        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.
